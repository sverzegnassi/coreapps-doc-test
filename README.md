A powerful GNU/Linux terminal emulator, designed for converging on desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

### Branches

- `vivid` is the target for Ubuntu Touch 15.04
- `xenial` (current) is the target for Ubuntu Touch 16.04

### Installing

Latest stable version of UBports Terminal app is available on [OpenStore](https://open.uappexplorer.com/app/com.ubuntu.terminal). 

### Building from scratch

We support Clickable as a standardized way to compile Ubuntu Touch application.

One of the main driving factors behind switching over this new tool is the better support cross distro.
It's a unified CLI tool that leverages all the Docker goodies, and allows us to build, test, and install .click applications on Ubuntu Touch and any GNU/Linux distribution.

To build and run terminal-app on your Ubuntu Touch device, ensure Clickable is installed on your machine.

On Ubuntu:

```
  $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:bhdouglass/clickable
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install clickable
  $ clickable setup-docker
```

On other GNU/Linux distros you need to install the Git version. Please refer to the official [Clickable install guide](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable/blob/master/README.md) for installing the tool on your system.

Once Clickable is initialized on your system:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ubports/terminal-app.git
  $ cd terminal-app
  $ clickable
```

This command will build terminal-app inside an Ubuntu 15.04 Docker container.
It will also create a .click package for Ubuntu Touch, and try to install it on your device if plugged to your PC.

To build and run the application on your desktop machine, run instead:

```
  $ clickable --desktop
```

Your X display will be forwarded into a docker container and the app will run from there.
  
By default, clickable executes the following sub-commands: `kill clean build click-build install launch`

For all the options available, please refer to the [Clickable docs](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/).
